NOTE: A smaller test image (512x512) (sample_image2.png) is being used in the python file currently.
The two output folders contain the outputs of the functions applied to the original image that was given for the assignment.

NOTE: For the top right image shift - 10 iterations are run. The final dimensions are visible in the console.

NOTE: The custom canny function follows the steps outlined in slide 16 of the edges presentation

Run the Assignment1.py file using python3.x

Upon running the user is prompted with whether or not they want to add padding to the image, following this the user is asked if the image input is colored or not.
For this assignment all 4 cases can be tested:

Padded - Non colored
Padded - Colored
Non Padded - Non Colored
Non Padded - Colored

The terminal will show updates on what is being processed.

Once the image opens press any key proceed to the next image.
